# Corvus Decision Log

## Active Decisions

- Corvus is the Fantasy Football MVP product.
- Trade Analyzer is the front door.
- Draft Assistant is the preparation and seasonal tool.
- Omen of the Week / MVP Move is the main event.
- Start/Sit lives inside Omen / MVP Move.
- Waiver logic lives inside Omen / MVP Move unless explicitly separated later.
- Yahoo, Sleeper, and ESPN all matter.
- ESPN is essential but risky and needs recovery playbooks.
- ESPN recovery routes through `/account` with safe state/query context only.
- ESPN league selection belongs in a full Account section for MVP, not a modal.
- Omen may preserve safe request context after ESPN recovery, but the user must click to rerun.
- `espn_import_blocked` remains the MVP user-facing state; safe backend `reason_code` values may be added later.
- Security and privacy decisions are tracked in `Blueprints\security-privacy.md`; compliance evidence is tracked in `probo.yaml`.
- Users need plain-English reasoning, not heavy math.

## Open Decisions

- Final UI naming between Omen of the Week, Omen, MVP Move, or a combined label.
- Whether waiver logic ever becomes a separate product surface.
- Whether recovery analytics ship before or after the first paid launch gate.
